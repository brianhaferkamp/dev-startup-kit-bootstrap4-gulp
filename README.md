First of all you need NodeJS in order to run javascript on the console, you can go to the [NodeJS](http://nodejs.rg) site and follow trough the installation process. After you get the `node` command on the console, you need to install Gulp and Bower globally with the following command.

## How to use
To start using it, the only thing you need to do is open the project on you code editor of choice and code. To compile and live preview all your changes you have some command that will help you. Here are the list of commands you should know.

Every command have to be executed on the root directory of the project using the gulp command like `gulp clean` or `gulp build`

* **start**: Compile and watch for changes (For development)
* **clean**: Removes all the compiled files on ./build
* **js**: Compile the JavaScript files
* **jade**: Compile the Jade templates
* **sass**: Compile the Sass styles
* **images**: Copy the newer to the build folder
* **favicon**: Copy the favicon to the build folder
* **vendors**: Copy the vendors to the build folder
* **build**: Build the project
* **watch**: Watch for any changes on the each section
* **help**: Print this message
* **browsersync**: Start the browsersync server

If you are in the development proccess, the `gulp start` command is the best option for you. Go to the folder project in the console and execute `gulp start`, it will compile the project and start server that will refresh every time you change something in the code. The command will be waiting for changes and will tell you how to access the project from local and public url. Every browser that point to that url will be auto refreshed. As an extra feature for testing purpose any interaction on one browser will be reflected on any others. Try it on a phone, tablet and pc at the same time .
